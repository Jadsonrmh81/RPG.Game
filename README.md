# RPG.py – Python Dictionaries Project

This is my first project using Python dictionaries.  
It is still under development.

## How the program works

When you start the program, you have two options:

- Type `exit` to finish the program
- Enter your player name (example: `ghost329`)

**Note:**  
The player name must have between **5 and 12 characters**.

## Gameplay

After entering a valid name, you can choose what to do:

- `exit` – finishes the game and shows your final score
- `tasks` – lets you choose an activity:
  - `train`
  - `to work`
  - `study`
  - `sleep`

Each task gives a different amount of points.

The goal is to make choices and increase your score.
